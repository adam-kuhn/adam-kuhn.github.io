            <p class="question">Have you ever been blocked on an easy problem?</p>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>Yes, I have. I had to write a "for loop", and could not figure out why my code would not run. I turned to Google and looked at a number of examples. I was sure mine was set up exactly like the examples, but it still wouldn't work. I then
                opened up Developer Tools in Chrome. I used console.log() to show me the array (list) I was trying to loop through. My list was correct, but I was receiving a weird error, that my variable defining the list didn't exist. After poking around
                with Dev Tools, I eventually realized that I had a typo in my in my variable that I used to define the "for loop." So I fixed the typo and my code ran exactly as it was supposed to.</p>
              <p>I was quite frusturated with myself as I tried to figure out the problem. I find that I get stubborn and can get really focused in on one aspect of the problem. I need to remember that it is ok to step away from the problem for a bit and
                return with a refreshed mind.</p>

            <p class="question">Have you ever solved a problem in an elegant way?</p>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>To solve a problem elegantly essential means to use few lines of code in a clever way. I don't think any of my solutions have been elegant, but whenever I am able to create a sucessful loop, with conditional if/else statements, I think I
                see a glimpse of elegance.</p>
              <p>Whenever I come up with a working solution, I feel quite proud. I enjoy the feeling of solving a puzzle and watching all the moving parts come together to produce the result. It seems that when I am able to produce a working solution <em>relatively</em>                easily, it's because I have taken time to understand what I need to do before I actually write any code.</p>

            <br>
            <p class="question">Comment on your ability to Read Error Messages.</p>
            <p class="answer">This is something I need to work on. I typically glance over them, and immediately look at my code. I need to read the error message first, as it will likely helps me understand where my code is wrong.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="question">Comment on your ability to console.log.</p>
            <p class="answer">This is something, I am just learning. I found it very useful the few times I have used it. I will continue to use in the future.</p>

            <p class="question">Define .map()</p>
            <p class="answer">This function will create a new array, by taking one array, running a function on every element of that array, and then saving the resulting values to the new array.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="question">Define .filter()</p>
            <p class="answer">This function will create a new array, by taking one array, running a conditional function (true/false) on every element of that array, and then save the values that returned true to the new array.</p>
