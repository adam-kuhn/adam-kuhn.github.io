            <p class="question">What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</p>
            <p class="answer">I've had the luxury (or not) to experience both the compassionate leader, and the non compassionate leader in both sports and the workplace. And it is no surprise that the compassionate leader brought out the best in me and the team. Knowing
              that the leader cared about me and the team, I was able to put out my best effort, and more to achieve our common goal. Whereas with the non compassionate leader, I was unable to rally behind there cause and therefore would not put forth
              my best effort.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="question">Comment on the multiplying goodness meditation.</p>
            <p class="answer">This was unique to say the least. This practice had to be one of the more "woo woo" <em>(mystical)</em> practices of the book...And honestly I quite enjoyed it. While performing the mediation and afterward I felt genuinely happier than prior
              to meditation. Therefore maybe this technique isn't as "woo woo" as I thought.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="question">How did the Tonglen meditation go?</p>
            <p class="answer">Not well. I found this one was too hard to focus on what needed to be done. Breathing in the bad and breathing out the good, sounds easy enough but it was difficult for me when in the meditative state.
              <p class="question">How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase O experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</p>
              <p class="answer">The SCARF Model is used to determine our social behaviour and stands for Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness. Status did not play a big part throughout Phase O as I acomplished the vast majority of the work on my own.
                Certainty definitly lead to frusturation as there were many times I thought I knew something...but clearly did not, or I would get stumped on a simple problem. While working at home and at my own pace I had control over my environment
                while working, which resulted in low stress related to Autonomy. for Relatedness I thought everyone I chatted to online or in person was a friend, and am really encouraged by the welcoming mindset everyone has. I had no issue of any sort
                Fairness throughout Phase O.</p>
              <p class="answer"> For the bootcamp I expect that Satus and Autonomy will be the only aspects that will affect my behavior differently than in Phase O. Status concerns me slightly as I anticipate the other students will have a better grasp on concepts than
                I do. Autonomy will also affect me differently as I won't have the convenience to be able to work when I want, where I want. I do believe the rest of the domains will remain relatively unchanged. I still won't be certain about many things
                (Certainty). I think everyone will still be very welcoming and friendly (Relatedness). I think everyone will be treaded fairly (Fairness).
                <br>
                <p class="question">Have a difficult conversation. How did it go?</p>
                <p class="answer">I have no difficult conversation I have been avoiding at the moment...I can't recall any in particular in the past. I'll think on this and write a better answer when/if one occurs.</p>
