    <li class="question">What did you learn from chapter 1 of Search Inside Yourself?
      <ul>
        <li class="answer">I learned that of the six charactersitics of top performers in the tech industry only two are related to inttellectual competencies (conceptual thinking and analytical ability). The other four characteristic (strong achievment drive and high achievment
          standards, ability to influence, initiative in taking on challenges, and self-confidence) are emotional competencies.</li>
        <li class="answer">Happiness is a skill. And like any other skill happiness can be trained.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="question">How did you find the 2 minutes of mindfulness?
      <p class="answer"> The 2 minutes of mindfulnes was quite enjoyable. I found it very relaxing to simply sit there and <em>just be</em>. I did not move for the 2 minutes, but I gained a new perspective and appreciation of my legs...It sounds weird but I could feel my
        legs as I was just <em>being</em>, and I simply was appreciating how they are a part of my body.</p>
