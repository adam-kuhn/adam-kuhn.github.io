    <li class="question">Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?
      <p class="answer"> I tried meditation.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="question">What did you find interesting?
      <p class="answer"> I found the research into meditation to be interesting. I also found the definition of Flow to really surprise me. The idea of flow being the perfect balance between boredom and anxiety, makes a whole lot of sense. And the need for a "challenge"
        enter flow, resenoates with me because at my old job I was rarely in flow, because I was never challenged. Whereas even in the first few days of Phase_0 I've experienced flow. Bring on the challenge</p>
    </li>
    <li class="question">What worked for you?
      <p class="answer"> Meditation did not "work," but it was interesting and I will try it more. Having a better understanding of Flow, I think will help enter this state more often.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="question">Which will you experiment further with?
      <p class="answer"> I intend to keep working with meditation, and work on timeboxing/pomodoro techniques.</p>
    </li>
