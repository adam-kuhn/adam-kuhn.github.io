  <h1>Time and Habits</h1>
  <a href="../index.html">Home</a>
  <p class="question"><strong>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</strong>
    <p> I tried meditation.</p>
    <p class="question"><strong>What did you find interesting?</strong>
      <p> I found the research into meditation to be interesting. I also found the definition of Flow to really surprise me. The idea of flow being the perfect balance between boredom and anxiety, makes a whole lot of sense. And the need for a "challenge"
        to enter flow, resenoates with me because at my old job I was rarely in flow, because I was never challenged. Whereas even in the first few days of Phase_0 I've experienced flow. Bring on the challenge!
      </p>
      <p class="question"><strong>What worked for you?</strong>
        <p> Meditation did not "work," but it was interesting and I will try it more. Having a better understanding of Flow, I think will help enter this state more often.
        </p>
        <p class="question"><strong>Which will you experiment further with?</strong>
          <p> I intend to keep working with meditation, and work on timeboxing/pomodoro techniques.
