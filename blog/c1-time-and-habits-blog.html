  <p>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?<br> I tried meditation.</p>
  <p>What did you find interesting?<br> I found the research into meditation to be interesting. I also found the definition of Flow to really surprise me. The idea of flow being the perfect balance between boredom and anxiety, makes a whole lot of sense.
    And the need for a "challenge" to enter flow, resenoates with me because at my old job I was rarely in flow, because I was never challenged. Whereas even in the first few days of Phase_0 I've experienced flow. Bring on the challenge!
  </p>
  <p>What worked for you?<br> Meditation did not "work," but it was interesting and I will try it more. Having a better understanding of Flow, I think will help enter this state more often.
  </p>
  <p>Which will you experiment further with?<br> I intend to keep working with meditation, and work on timeboxing/pomodoro techniques.
