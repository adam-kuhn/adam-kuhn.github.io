            <p class="question">How did the "Process over Product" concept affect the way you tackled the redesign of your site?</p>
            <p class="answer">I found this idea encourages you to try absolutely anything. If the end product isn't great, who cares as long as you learned and focused on the process of performing the task you set out for. It is still possible to learn, without delivering
              a perfect product. However i did find myself putting a lot more time into this weeks sprint, because I would be close to figuring something out, and I wanted to see it through. And I kept wanting to try more things. By no means is my design
              or code perfect but I am happy with what I've created at this point three weeks into coding(Oct 20, 2017). I definitely learned a lot this week.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="question">What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself?</p>
            <p class="answer">I have been exposed to meditation in the last few weeks and therefore had a familar view as to what was expressed in chapter 2.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="question">What new things have you learned about meditation?</p>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>I learned that meditation is "mental exercise." The same way we train our physical wellness by working out, we can and should do this same with our mind.
                <p><em>“Every time your attention wanders away from your breath and you bring it back, it is like flexing your biceps—your “muscle” of attention grows a bit stronger.”Excerpt From: Tan, Chade-Meng. “Search Inside Yourself: The Unexpected
                  Path to Achieving Success, Happiness (and World Peace).” iBooks.</em></p>

                <p>I learned that happiness is the default set of the mind. When the mind is calm and clear, the mind returns to it's default state, happiness. Therefore you don't need to pursue happiness, simply <em>being</em> is happiness.</p>

            <br>
            <p class="question">Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</p>
            <p class="answer">I like the idea of sitting like a majestic mountain when finding your pose for meditation.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="question">Anything else you found interesting in Chapter 2?</p>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>There were a number of things I found interesting:
                <ol>
                  <li>Meditation can help you not be so critical of yourself.</li>
                  <li>Meditation can help you become your own best friend.</li>
                  <li> I also love how we don't need to pursue or find happiness. Because being happy is the default set of the mind.</li>
                  <li>I was also surprised by how many scientifc studies there are that show the benefits of meditation. One scientific study (Richard Davidson, et al., "Alterations in Brain and Immune Function Produced by Mindfulness Meditation") shows that
                    those who meditate, experience more positive emotions and have a better immune systems. Which I think is quite remarkable</p>
