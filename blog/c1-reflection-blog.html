    <li class="question">What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</li>
    <div>
      <p> It’ll be an entirely new learning environment that what is the norm. However, it seems to be appropriate and will really optimize the students’ potential.</p>
    </div>
    <li class="question">What are your impressions?</li>
    <div>
      <p> I feel that the EDA environment is a welcoming and safe place for students to learn, challenge themselves, and grow. But will require a great amount of work and engagement from the students. </p>
    </div>
    <li class="question">How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li>
    <div>
      <p> I envision myself being outgoing in this culture. I’ll attempt every challenge/task as best I can and communicate while communicating with both students and teachers in order to get the most out of this experience. I will also try to be vulnerable
        in admitting things I don’t know and ask for help when needed.</p>
    </div>
    <li class="question">Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</li>
    <div>
      <p> No.</p>
    </div>

    <li class="question">Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</li>
    <div>
      <p> Yes, I am very excited to learn and work in this new environment. I like the idea of collaboration and learning by doing, so I hope it all works out. Yes, I am nervous. There are many unknowns in how this will all shake out, but I intend to jump
        head first.</p>
