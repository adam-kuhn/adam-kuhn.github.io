  <h1>Reflection</h1>
  <a href="../index.html">Home</a>
  <p class="question"><strong>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</strong>
    <p> It’ll be an entirely new learning environment that what is the norm. However, it seems to be appropriate and will really optimize the students’ potential.</p>
    <p class="question"><strong>What are your impressions?</strong>
      <p> I feel that the EDA environment is a welcoming and safe place for students to learn, challenge themselves, and grow. But will require a great amount of work and engagement from the students. </p>

      <p class="question"><strong>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</strong>
        <p> I envision myself being outgoing in this culture. I’ll attempt every challenge/task as best I can and communicate while communicating with both students and teachers in order to get the most out of this experience. I will also try to be vulnerable
          in admitting things I don’t know and ask for help when needed.</p>

        <p class="question"><strong>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</strong>
          <p> No.
          </p>

          <p class="question"><strong>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</strong>
            <p> Yes, I am very excited to learn and work in this new environment. I like the idea of collaboration and learning by doing, so I hope it all works out. Yes, I am nervous. There are many unknowns in how this will all shake out, but I intend to
              jump in head first.</p>
