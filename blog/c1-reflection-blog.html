  <p>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?<br> It’ll be an entirely new learning environment that what is the norm. However, it seems to be appropriate and will really optimize the students’ potential.</p>
  <p>What are your impressions?<br> I feel that the EDA environment is a welcoming and safe place for students to learn, challenge themselves, and grow. But will require a great amount of work and engagement from the students. </p>

  <p>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?<br> I envision myself being outgoing in this culture. I’ll attempt every challenge/task as best I can and communicate while communicating with both students and teachers in order to get the
    most out of this experience. I will also try to be vulnerable in admitting things I don’t know and ask for help when needed.</p>

  <p>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?<br> No.
  </p>

  <p>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?<br> Yes, I am very excited to learn and work in this new environment. I like the idea of collaboration and learning by doing, so I hope it all works out.
    Yes, I am nervous. There are many unknowns in how this will all shake out, but I intend to jump in head first.</p>
