  <h3>Designs I'd like to add:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li class="answer">Background with overlapping boxes and the occassional picture.
      <a class="textlink" href="http://www.csszengarden.com/221/">Example 1</a>
      <a class="textlink" href="http://www.csszengarden.com/217/">Example 2</a>
    </li>
    <li class="answer">I'd like to have a design and overall layout similar to this
      <a class="textlink" href="http://www.csszengarden.com/218/">Example 3</a>
    </li>
    <li class="answer">The retro feel in <a class="textlink" href="http://www.csszengarden.com/212/">Example 4</a> is a style I'd like to replicate. This theme is similar to certain styles portrayed in the <a class="textlink" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/241857442466053718/">BioShock</a>      and
      <a class="textlink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/b/bf/Fallout_4_perk_poster.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151005052434">FallOut</a> games. The contrast of the design and the content creates a unique overall feeling.
    </li>
    <li class="answer">I like how the page appears to be a banner and scrolls smoothly across the background in <a class="textlink" href="http://www.csszengarden.com/216/">Example 5</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Questions:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li class="question">What is a good analogy for HTML, CSS and the DOM?
      <ul>
        <li class="answer">
          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation on which the website is built. HTML is therefore similar to the foundation and structure of a house. A house must be built from the ground up and so must a website. First the foundation of the house is
          built (the header in HTML), then the framework (body), and then people can move in (this would be the content). We now have a bare house (but it is liveable).
        </li>
        <li class="answer">
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the interior designer who comes in and styles the home exactly how you want it, buy painting the walls, adding additional features, and removing unwanted clutter.
        </li>
        <li class="answer">
          DOS (Document Object Model) organizes HTML into a tree with multiple branches, that all come out of the foundation of structure. In reference to the house model, two different rooms in the house may look like this:<br> <strong>Room 1:</strong>          foundation<span>&#10137;</span>house<span>&#10137;</span>living room
          <span>&#10137;</span>kitchen<br>
          <strong>Room 2:</strong> foundation<span>&#10137;;</span>house<span>&#10137;</span>living room<span>&#10137;</span>stairs<span>&#10137;</span>bedroom
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li class="question">What is boxifying design?
      <p class="answer">Boxifying is the process used to breakout all the indivdual elements displayed on webpage. Begin by drawing large boxes around groups of elements. Then draw smaller and smaller boxes around each grouping of elements, until only single elements remain.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="question">What is the Box Model?
      <p class="answer">The Box Model describes the make up of all websites. Every element displayed is defined as a box. Yes, even circles are boxes on websites.</p>
    </li>
