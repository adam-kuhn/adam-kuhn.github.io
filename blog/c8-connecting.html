            <p class="question">Complete the political awareness exercise below.</p>
            <ul class="answer">
              <li><strong>The Situation:</strong> I had to bring a lot of gear to and from work one day, due to a work function and I would not be heading home until very late. Drinks would be had at this function and I did not want to leave my car downtown
                over night. One of my colleagues, who wasn't participating in the function said he could drive my car home after work, and then come pick me and my gear up later that night. However my colleage instead ending up drinking with people after
                work, and therefore could not drive my car home nor pick me up. Therefore my colleague got one of their friends (who was sober) to drive my car home. The partying for them continued and therefore they were unable to pick me up later that
                night. As a result when I got back from the function, I had to walk home.
              </li>
              <li><strong>My Perspective:</strong> I was furious because I my colleage did not do what I had asked nor what he promised. He instead went out partying, and got his friend to drive my car, leaving my stranded. I did not give permission to his
                friend to drive my car and I was counting on my colleague to pick me and my gear up.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Their Perspective:</strong> If I go out with a few friends after work and have a few drinks. I will make sure to make arrangements to get Adam's car home. Adam doesn't want to leave his car overnight, so as long as his car is home
                he will be happy.
