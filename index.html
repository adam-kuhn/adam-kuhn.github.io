  <h3>TrackApp is now live for all iOS devices</h3>
    <p>
      TrackApp is a clean, simple workout tracking tool that gives you the 
      power to track your workouts however you want!
    </p>
    <p>
      With its minimalist design you can track all of your workouts no 
      matter the type: running, swimming, strength training, HIT, and 
      CrossFit are all easily trackable within TrackApp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key to the success of TrackApp is for you to keep your tracking 
      consistent. With minimal input fields you are not overwhelmed with 
      exercise types, and various configurations. Track the values you 
      want within a given field and the progression tracker does the rest. 
      You'll able to easily compare exercises done across multiple sessions, 
      to help gauge progression and determine what volume should be done in 
      your next session.</p>
