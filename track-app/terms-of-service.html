      <h1>TrackApp Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>
        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of TrackApp (“the
        Application”, provided by the TrackApp team ("we", "our", or "us")). By
        purchasing, installing, or using the Application, you agree to these
        Terms.
      </p>

      <h3>License to Use</h3>
      <p>
        Upon purchase, you are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable license
        to use the Application for personal or authorized business purposes. Your
        right to use the Application continues for as long as the Application
        remains in service and supported by us.
      </p>

      <h3>Service Availability</h3>
      <p>
        The Application relies on our servers and related infrastructure to
        function. We may, at our sole discretion, update, modify, limit, or
        discontinue the Application, including permanently shutting down the
        servers.
      </p>

      <h3>No Refunds for Service Termination</h3>
      <p>
        In the event the Application or its servers are discontinued, you
        acknowledge and agree that:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Your right to use the Application will end when the Application is no
          longer in service.
        </li>
        <li>
          No refunds, credits, or reimbursements will be issued for unused time,
          prior purchases, or discontinued access.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>User Responsibility</h3>
      <p>
        You agree to use the Application in compliance with all applicable laws
        and not to misuse, redistribute, or reverse-engineer the Application.
      </p>

      <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any damages,
        losses, or claims resulting from:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The Application being discontinued or unavailable.</li>
        <li>
          Any loss of data, functionality, or access related to termination of
          service.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Changes to These Terms</h3>
      <p>
        These terms replaces all previous terms. We reserve the right to change
        these terms at any time.
